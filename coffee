# Ann Arbor Cafes Review

I love Cafes, the smell of the grounds, the screech of the espresso machine, the young startups with their laptop stickers, the loosely knit sweaters cradling thick mugs, I love it all. I want to share my experiences in Ann Arbor Cafes with you so you'll be an expert when you get into Arbor Town. I love comparisons and point systems so I'm going to make one to size up the best Cafes in AA.

### The Point System

Cafes will be awarded points for various categories. A Cafe is not defined by it's coffee or it's owners but by many little elements, I'll try and get a glimpse of each little piece of a Cafes identity by spending about an hour inside. Then I'll award points for each category and add them up to form an overall rating.

**Normal Coffee** - I'll try the house blend and see how I like it, this category is pretty subjective. I'll do my best to describe how they taste. Since coffee is the most important part of a coffee shop (arguably) I will allot it **4 points**. 

**Price** - As a college student, I'm constantly checking the price, and with a product as common as coffee, a couple cents can make a difference over time. I'll post the price of a medium house cup. Price can be either cheap, expensive or crazy, so I'll give this category **2 points**.

**Music** - A huge part of a cafe atmosphere is the music choice and how it's presented. Sometimes you can bump to a beat with your fellow coffee drinkers and other times you find yourself scrambling for headphones. **1 point** will be given to music.

**Atmosphere** - This quality is made up by the interior design, floor plan, and other small factors which can take the shape of many different things, I'm excited to see what those things will be! **3 points** will be up for grabs for cafe atmosphere.

**Comfort** - Often I find myself in the battle for the comfortable parts of a cafe, nice furniture, open outlets, foot room. Is it hard to find these elements or are they abundant? **2 points** will be awarded for overall comfort.

**Wifi Speeds** - Usain Bolt once said, "You are only as fast as your WiFi". But actually, I've been driven out of many a cafe by slow wifi speeds. I'll run a speed test and allot **3 points** based on the results.

#### Recap

In total **15 points** are up for grabs and a great Cafe should be able to get them all. I'll go through the Cafes in no particular order and we'll see who has the highest score in the end! We'll start on State and work our way West.

# Espresso Royale

#### Coffee 3/4

I loved the house blend. It was full and didn't leave any watery aftertaste. It tasted wholesome in a way a hamburger does, like coffee for the masses. It didn't surprise me but still fulfilled me in the best way coffee could. For the busy student looking for a hot cup of caffeine, this hits the spot without any unneeded extras.

#### Price 2/2

**$1.75** Pretty cheap for a medium brewed coffee. Espresso also features a really broad menu with breakfast and lunch foods. 

#### Music 0/1

The music in Espresso is notoriously varied, depending on the barista spinning the playlist, you can be listening to deep house, top 40s, or the Van-Halen style jam rock that I'm hearing now. It's usually drowned out by the medium voice levels but can be exposed at slower times. Often I find myself making sure to bring headphones to override the music. **0 points* for music. 

#### Atmosphere 2/3

This particular Espresso Royale is like a long cave. You can sit in the chairs by the window or go deeper in to find bigger tables and dimmer lighting. The layout of the Cafe is absolutely brilliant. Right when you walk in you are presented with the menu and smiling baristas waiting to take your order. After ordering you can slide down the pipeline away from the register to pick up your order and add any creamers or utensils you need. From there you can loop around to exit or pick any of the many seating options from couches, to tables, to single seats. It's a subtly beautiful loop that makes things run very smoothly. Espresso has an advantage in a very large space compared to smaller Cafes, but they utilize it well. Espresso is the official meeting place of many group projects and local Meetup Groups like Coffee House Coders and also features poetry slams from time to time. For all these things I'll give Espresso **2 points** for atmosphere. 

#### Comfort 2/2

With a ton of different seating options, it's easy to find your spot in Espresso. Some people love to collapse on the couches, some find them to be very dirty. Whatever your interest is, there's usually a spot for you here. Most all the tables have outlets by them allowing you to stay past your battery lifetime. The chairs are nice, light, and sturdy. The comfort of Espresso lies in it's varied options. I don't feel funneled into a certain Cafe experience, but allowed to find my own. The location is prime for most students who have class anywhere near state. It's open until midnight which is standard among Cafes. To me Espresso is an Ann Arbor classic. 

#### Wifi 1/3

What's good about this is that the Wifi is working and usable. If you're doing a lot of web intensive work however, this can be a problem. Due to Espresso's size, at any time there are likely around 150+ devices on the network (phones and laptops), and this can really slow things down. Espresso's public Wifi is **WPA**, which has known vulnerabilities. Personally, I have found Espressos Wifi to be very inconsistent, either working fine or bumping me off. That can be very frustrating. So I'll give Espresso **1 point**.

#### Total 11/15

# Starbucks

#### Coffee 2/4 

Nice light taste, didn't taste as full as Espresso's house blend. Starbucks' Pike Place is a classic blend they've had since the beginning. As much as I try to not be a victim of brand hype, the pretty logo on the well-built cup seemed to make the coffee taste better. All things considered it was aight, **2 points** to Starbucks Pike Place.

*Many Cafes have in house cups that can be used and then returned to minimize waste. Since myself and many others don't want to buy a $35 Starbucks thermos, we're tossing our Starbucks coffees into the trash most of the time. 

#### Price 1/2

**$2.10** -  More expensive than we've seen but this is how the Starbucks brand operates successfully. You'll find most other Starbucks products to be a little more expensive, and when you're attending a very expensive university, an extra dollar for coffee isn't a huge sacrifice.

#### Music 1/1

The Starbucks music playlist must be one of the most heavily guarded secrets in the company. I know music to be an essential element of a nice atmosphere and when you can't always please everyone, it makes song selection very hard. Starbucks has done an incredible job developing this playlist and they don't blast it in your ears either. Feel free to put in headphones or enjoy the cafe bustle sounds along with this superb playlist.

#### Atmosphere 1/3

As mentioned earlier, the Starbucks brand is one of the most recognizable in the world, and it's stores follow strict franchise guidelines to keep them looking like magical Seattle Cafes even when attached to Speedway gas stations. Starbucks must also push this brand outside the door farther than disposable cups can. For this reason, Starbucks is as much a Store as it is a Cafe, products of all kinds line the walls, all stamped with the familiar green mermaid logo. This often takes up a lot of space that could be used for seating. 

#### Comfort 1/2

Starbucks has a very diverse furniture selection so whether you like the high chairs by the window or sitting at the table with the rest of Ann Arbor, chances are you'll find something you like. However be prepared to come early to lock something down as the main cabin of this Starbucks fills up very quickly.

#### Wifi 2/3

![Speed Test Result](http://www.speedtest.net/result/5235941956.png)

Starbucks partners with Google to provide free Wifi which is very dependable. I've never had issues with the Wifi inside any Starbucks which is pretty incredible for a national chain to manage. If you can find a seat and get comfortable, then your internet experience should be smooth as well.
